"sbook" (short for spellbook) it's a kind of minimal framework for web application development in PHP.
It was developed initially by Nuno Ferreira at Wiz Interactive and later joined by Jorge Pena.

Nowadays its continually being updated, still at Wiz Interactive, as work demands. 

Although it's rather obsolete compared to almost all PHP frameworks out there, and most of it is still 
using PHP 4 code and very heavy libs like PEAR/MDB2 and is hopelessly undocumented, it gets the job 
done and works all over the place be it Linux or Windows, PHP 4 or 5, MySQL 4 or 5.
